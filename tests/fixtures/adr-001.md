# Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Rationale

PostgreSQL offers the best combination of reliability, performance, and features.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | 9 | Best overall |
| MySQL | 7 | Good but fewer features |
| SQLite | 5 | Not suitable for production |

# Consequences

## Positive

Reliable ACID transactions and great ecosystem.

## Negative

More operational complexity than SQLite.
