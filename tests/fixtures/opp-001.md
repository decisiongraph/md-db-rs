# Problem

Users cannot edit documents simultaneously. This causes version conflicts and slows teams down.

# Proposed Solution

Implement operational transform (OT) or CRDT-based real-time editing with cursor presence.

# Success Criteria

- Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously
- Changes merge without conflicts in >99% of cases
- Latency under 200ms for edits

# Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| CRDT complexity | High | High | Use proven library (yjs/automerge) |
| Network latency | Medium | Medium | Optimistic local-first updates |
| Data loss | Low | Critical | WAL + periodic snapshots |

# Open Questions

- OT vs CRDT? Need ADR.
- WebSocket vs SSE for transport?
